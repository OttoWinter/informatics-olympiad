# GSS3 - Can you answer these queries III

> Source: http://www.spoj.com/problems/GSS3/

You are given a sequence `A` of `N` (`N` <= 50000) integers between -10000 and 10000. On this sequence you have to apply `M` (`M` <= 50000) operations: 

* modify the `i`-th element in the sequence
* for given `x`, `y` print `max{A_i + A_{i+1} + .. + A_j | x<=i<=jâ‰¤y }` - i.e. the maximal sum subsequence between `i` and `j` (inclusive).

## Input

The first line of input contains an integer `N`. The following line contains `N` integers, representing the sequence `A_1..A_N`. 
The third line contains an integer `M`. The next `M` lines contain the operations in following form:

* 0 `x` `y`: update `A_x` to `y` (|`y`| <= 10000).
* 1 `x` `y`: print `max{Ai + Ai+1 + .. + Aj | x<=i<=j<=y }`.

## Output

For each query, print an integer as the problem required.

## Example

**Input:**

```text
4
1 2 3 4
4
1 1 3
0 3 -3
1 2 4
1 3 3
```

**Output:**

```text
6
4
-3
```
